<h2>Global Schedule Preferences</h2>
Global preferences are your default availability times for the semester
(times you're free to work every week).
If you have a one-off change in availability, like a doctors appointment,
you can change your availability for the week in the non-reccuring preferences page,
and it will not affect your global preferences.
